# Tic-Tac-Toe

### Objective
Attempt to build an RL agent that can learn to play numerical Tic-Tac-Toe with odd numbers. The environment will play randomly, playing the even numbers. The goal is to train the agent enough to win majority of the games. 

### Steps Involved
    - Developing the Environment
    - Define epsilon-greedy strategy
    - Track state-action pairs for convergence
    - Define hyperparameters for the Q-learning algorithm
    - Generate episode and applying Q-update equation
    - Checking convergence in Q-values
